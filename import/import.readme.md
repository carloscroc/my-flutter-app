I started the inventory step and loaded the FlutterFlow-exported home.md so we can implement a native rewrite. This file is long (thousands of lines) and will be used as the reference for implementing the native Home page.


import folder are files from flutterflow. 
we are not going to use flutter flow in this project.
we only use flutter and the latest version of flutter.
