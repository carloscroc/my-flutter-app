I started the inventory step and loaded the FlutterFlow-exported home.md so we can implement a native rewrite. This file is long (thousands of lines) and will be used as the reference for implementing the native Home page.
create a todo list to review and test loop that re run the home_page.dart until match home,md file strtucture, styles (header icons, large greeting, day chips, dark card, featured horizontal list, help card with CTA, category chips with SVGs, workouts horizontal gallery, meditative horizontal list, centered assessment button), we are not creating new files we, we can go from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen adjuting every single little thing


import folder are files from flutterflow. 
we are not going to use flutter flow in this project.
we only use flutter and the latest version of flutter.
